This time I am glad that I ordered the brioche french toast which was really awesome. However, the service at The Grounds of the City really needs to be improved. The tables weren t fully occupied and did not seem busy at the time I dined in with my sister, I asked for some maple syrup to pour over the french toast. I had to ask two times from the same staff and one more time from a different staff then I finally got the maple syrup. By the time I received the maple syrup, I was already half done with my dish. Also, my sister ordered the rose and watermelon shake and said it clearly to the waitress. Instead, she got served a glass of banana milkshake rather than the one she wanted to order. We asked the waitress and it got changed to rose and watermelon shake later. Also, we asked for the bill twice for it to be delivered the table. I find that the service wasn t that attentive and extremely slow. The bill amount is $51.7 and I paid $51.8 in which I expect a $0.1 change. But the waitress didn t come back with the change and I did not want to trouble the staff too much so we left with bringing it up.

It was my in-laws birthday and he managed to ruin it. Never been treated like this at any restaurant before and I am 60 years old. While the manager was clearly having a bad day with trying to manage the crowds of people, I could not help wondering if I would have been treated differently if I was white. On the other hand, the waitstaff inside were fabulous. Couldn t fault them at all for their competence and kindness.

The waiter witnessed me pulling it slowly out of my otherwise delicious brioche french toast and whisked the plate away.  The manager did the right thing and offered a fresh plate / alternatives but I felt sick and left. I did get my coffee for free though.  The noise level was awful. The man child at the next table conducted a very loud phone conversation for the entirety of my visit including some frankly commercially sensitive information. I couldn’t hear myself think which probably wasn’t so bad given what was in my food.  This was my new favourite place and I’m now very disappointed.","1","Steakandchips","02-10-2019"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","Based on this particular experience I answered not to the above question. I come to the grounds quite frequently and this was a disappointing experience. Firstly I lined up in the line that said “pre-booked reservations” which I assumed was there to fast track those who had booked but whenever the host came back to the entry he kept taking people from the other line. It wasn’t until I stepped in, and felt quite rude for doing so, that he took notice of us in the other line waiting. Then my friend who is a vegetarian ordered the omelette without pancetta, we were assured this was possible. The waiter even announced it was pancetta free when he put it down. After a few bites she asked me, if that’s pancetta and when she opened the omelette there was pancetta throughout. Another omelette was brought out but we were still charged for the omelette which I was surprised about.","3","Sophie","27-08-2019"

When it eventually arrived, the coffee was barely lukewarm, and then they forgot to bring our food to the table. When we asked after our meal, it arrived promptly but was stone cold. I returned my meal and the subsequent meal was barely above cold. It was clear that they d left our food on the counter and didn t prepare the meal fresh when this was discovered, and we were offered nothing apart from an embarrassed apology by the wait person. I contacted Grounds about this but they ve chosen not to respond.","1","SharonL","27-08-2019"

There should have been a second person attending to other customers with an existing booking given that was a peak time during Thurs lunch.    My guest and I ordered the bouillabaisse but it was cold and the bread that came with it soggy. The prawns were also not very fresh and I couldn’t peel the shell off easily. We also ordered fries which came with a blob of Parmesan stock to them instead of evenly spread across the top of the fries (which is how I think they were supposed to be served and) so we basically had to discard that whole chunk as it was all stuck together and ate the remainder.

Wink wink. But they give you a tiny glass and water top up is less than the desired frequency. I wonder if dehydration for customers in a F&B establishment should be considered OHS hazard.     $22 for an omelette with some ingredients inside not even reaching room temperature, perhaps they had to wait for permission for entry and spent too much time in the cold air too.

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","We will start off this review giving credit where it is due.  The ambiance, location and food (in general) is good.    Having said, that, the service is consistently below par, seeming to strive to hit new depths with each visit.  During this most recent visit (and I do always say the last), when a guest asked if the poached egg with the avocado on toast could be scrambled instead, she was advised  We can t scramble 1 egg .  Umm, really?  Not possible?  Not at all?  Never in the history of egg preparation has someone been asked to scramble a single egg?  Huh.  Who knew?  With no solution forthcoming for this seemingly unsolvable problem - she did what any good customer who was clearly in the wrong did - she ordered the omlette.    And we shouldn t get started on the  Greeting  staff.  After we arrived at the restaurant (with a reservation made 3 days prior) we were greeted by someone who clearly wished they were anywhere else and were advised to  Wait (outside in the rain) while we check to see if your table is ready .  Spoiler alert, it wasn t.  There was a bright spark in this visit - one lone member of the wait staff who was energetic, enthusiastic and helpful.  He must be new.  No doubt the rest of the staff will help him adopt the Grounds of the City work ethos.","1","AmyP","16-06-2019"

Was disappointed but do understand that this is not the fault of the café - as those items are quite popular. However the service we received this time was terrible. There was a waitress who was rude and unpleasant. Was surprised that such a coffeehouse that prides itself in its ambience and service would be okay with hiring somebody like this.","2","KLll","16-06-2019"

The staff were very attentive without being overbearing. The food was fresh and delicious. The food came out relatively quickly, which I appreciated as my lunch date has a rather short attention span. What let them down was the lack of toilet facilities. The 4 yr old needed to use th toilet. I was given instructions to use the toilets 2 levels up. We ended up using the facilities at Grill d after they took pity of me.","4","Omarvincent01","04-05-2019"

Things that perhaps can be improved on - long wait to place an order, had to ask a passing member of staff. Coffee was very prompt but teas were made and waited on the counter for 15min to be brought to the table. We were having pastries but no plates were offered, had to ask for plates.  All in all, all members of your team when talking  into us were friendly and helpful but it felt a bit like they were all rushed and no one in particular was in charge of our little table.

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","I loved everything about my first visit to The Grounds of the City. Having given up going to the Grounds of Alexandria because it s sooo crowded, I was pleasantly surprised to be able to book a table for 6 easily online and for a 5.30pm Friday night time-slot. We were given a beautifully decorated and comfortable nook which made for easy chatting in a group of 6. The wine was served in decent sized glasses - none of this tiny dribble in the bottom of a tankard you can be duped with in some places. Our next engagement was at 7pm so the service must have been speedy because we made it on time. The front of house manager and our waiters were all extremely friendly despite being run off their feet and for a cafe paying city rents, the prices were reasonable. I liked being asked how I wanted my burger meat cooked  cause I hate eating pink mince. $50 covered 2 glasses of wine, a burger with chips and salad plus a tip. The cost of sharing a meal with friends I ve known for decades - a price beyond rubies.","5","LuluM","08-03-2019"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","Usually really enjoyable but this time I feel they cut a few corners and it wasn’t the same experience. Eg: ice coffee was about 3 small plain water ice cubes, shot of coffee and the milk. Usually served like the pic in the menu and not plain ice cubes. No attention to presentation of the food which was disappointing and unlike previous ‘Grounds’ experiences. No busier than usual so I can’t even put that down as a possible excuse. Maybe becoming complacent with their position in the marketplace (?)

It was 10.45 a lady came out calling Annie, I thought she was calling out my name, so I went up to confirm she gave me the up and down look and disregarded me and did not even give me a response. She was very rude.   I was not impressed with my breakfast. I ordered avocado and they literally just cut 1/2 an avocado left the skin on. I could do that at home. I had to scoop out the avocado at a well known cafe.   I will definitely not return to this cafe.

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","I would recommend it to a friend but maybe try something else to what we had on this occasion -  Chilled Alpine Salmon Tartare: A bit light in appearance (just a half-bowl of chopped salmon, peas and sauce), but quality was good and flavour was pleasant, not overpowering.    I’d certainly order something different next time though – eg; the other tartare (kangaroo).    Marrickville Buffalo Mozzarella Salad: The portion sizes were way too small for this and the other dishes we ordered for the prices charged.  Crispy Fried 5 Spice Arrow Squid: Whilst it was not unpleasant to eat I would not jump to order this one again.  lyonnaise kipfler potatoes with thyme and onions (ordered to share) - I wouldn t mind to order this again but was a bit on the bland side.  We allowed 1hr for lunch and got there on time however, it took almost half hour for our order.  I had a look at the breakfast menu and would like to come back for that and maybe dessert and/or after work drinks as really love the atmosphere (not too loud in the place to hold a conversation with the people I was with).","3","JulsW","14-02-2019"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","The waitstaff were great, very friendly and customer focused. The food was fresh and delicious. The hostess however created a really poor CX. My friend who drove up from Wollongong was suck in traffic and advised me she was on her way and not far. The hostess after seating me came up soon after and asked if my friend was coming. She said the table booking was for 1.5 hours only and I d already used up 15 minutes of it.  My friend arrived sat down 2 minutes after this exchange and from that point on I was extremely conscious of the time, not enjoying the lunch/ambience and catch up with my friend because I felt we would be asked to leave.  I understand that The Grounds is a brand and it is a business, that there are people being turned away as the place is full. However, the customers who are dining in your premises should be given reasons to return, and that is through CX. Customers like myself will come once and go some place else where they are welcomed and not left feeling like just a transaction.  There are other places in the city I can buy a great lobster roll.","3","ReenaB","15-12-2018"

I really hate to say but on this occasion the service was poor to non existent! For example, we ordered a bottle of wine which was poured and then taken away, which is ok. However, our glasses stayed empty for most of the night and only when asked whether the bottle was finished did the waiter check. No it was not! I know there is a drought but even water was scarce. When we requested fromthe same waiter for plates to carve up a shared dessert, you expect a plate for each person on the table, but no, we got three plates for four people. I know these are pretty petty points but they added to satisfaction/dissatisfaction of the night.","2","OpenTable Diner","16-10-2018"

My partner had to wait another 15 mins for her replacement drink to arrive! This order should have been done straight away as priority.   I ordered a medium steak and it was like eating leather. Never had such an over cooked steak before! It was terrible!  Overall the food was bland and some of the potatoes were undercooked. Parts of my partners steak were rare when she ordered medium.   Overall it was a very disappointing meal, the service was slow and poor and the staff quite rude at times.

I was told I could only have the table for 90 mins and the clock for that would start clock when I sat down regardless of whether my dining companion had arrived and regardless of having made a booking. I queried this and was told there was no flexiblity so I needed to decide whether to be seated now and be ready to leave at 7:30 or to sit at 6:30 and leave 90 mins from then. This was bizarre considering there was empty tables in the restaurant all evening.   That aside, the menu was a little odd / disjointed.

My only gripe is that I think it’s a bit rich to charge me $4 for a slice of toast to go with my $21 omelette.  Omelette was great, avo toast was prefect, potato hash is a bit more like mash than a hash but still tasty.

Service was substandard (dropping our plates onto the table as they were passing without a single word to us). They tried to take our plates away while we were still eating, and once we d finished our mains, there was no offer of tea/coffee/dessert. The bill was immediately brought to us and placed on the table without a word (and also without us asking for it). We felt like we were being pushed out of the restaurant, which is a bit rich given we were there for less than an hour (less than an hour passed between our order being put in the system and the time on my receipt).

Had poke salad with poached chicken - delicious and decent amount for a lunch meal. Ambiance and decor is wonderful and a main reason to go - ask for a booth seat as you won t get jostled there, as aisles are narrow between tables and staff and other patrons seem to be on the move all the time.

It’s a cool looking place & the staff were friendly but the noise levels aren’t so much “lively” as annoying - it’s like the space has somehow been designed to make sound reverberate & carry more than usual because nobody was noticeably loud & it was a week day breakfast but I’ve been to quieter bars.","3","Raines79","16-08-2018"

The place is always busy but there is no shortage of staff to take your order or top up your water glass. They allocate each booking an hour and a half time slot, which is more than enough time to have a meal, (and follow it up wit coffee and cake) as the food comes out in a very reasonable amount of time, despite the high volume of customers.  The food is lovely - The ingredients are fresh and the servings are generous. I got what was probably the most generous amount of avocado I’d had at any cafe. The only criticisms I have are that the espresso shot for my iced mocha was quite small compared to the amount of milk they gave me, and also the noise level can be so high, that it’s hard to hear the person across from you at times!","4","MeredithD","08-08-2018"

The food menu was different from the last time we were there which is good to see as it indicates that the kitchen is offering new options to keep things interesting. We ordered a few different dishes to share including their house salad which was delicious. The highlight though is their dessert trolley, which includes favourites as their  Cake of the Day  and their popular strawberry sponge cake. Our table ordered both (to share)! Our table was there for a birthday lunch and can recommend this place for such special occasions, or even a nice meal with a few friends.","4","EvaP","28-07-2018"

One can simply stop by for a coffee and some delicious wicked-looking cake from the cake trolley, a cocktail and nibbles or a complete dinner. Service was patchy but friendly: we had to wait quite a while to receive our wine after we ordered it and also to have our food order taken, yet as soon as we said we did not want anything else at the end of the meal, we were presented with the bill and politely advised that we should pay as our table was needed, despite having no time limit placed on our reservation at the time of booking.

The food that did come out was tasty, but a bit cold.  Tea was lovely until it turned bitter. Leaves should not be left in the pot once the brew time is done as tea will continue to brew and turn bitter. Coffee presses are not suitable for tea for this very reason.","3","MrsO","08-07-2018"

The online booking option is excellent and made this the preferred catch up location.  I do have a few areas that weren t up to scratch. Firstly the line out the front didn t move for 10 mins yet we had a booking. Secondly the coffee order was lost and we had to reorder again. Thirdly we ordered avocado on toast which was unimpressive. It was served as two servings of toast with half an avocado in the middle. Is it that hard to place a quarter of an avo on each plate considering we re paying? We then ordered an extra avo but this was also lost and we gave up. The first coffee was waived as it came out too late as we had meetings to attend. It wasn t a great catch up.

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","A lovely venue and interesting menu, but our experience was marred by some serving issues, which included bringing the wrong wine to the table twice, then advising me that the red wine delivered the second time was  the right wine (no, I had ordered a white from the same maker...). By the time the issue was sorted out, my meal had been on the table for 10 minutes and was cold and past its best . I m sure the kitchen would have been horrified, as there was obvious care and attention paid in preparing the dish which included fresh truffle. My dining partner s meal looked lovely and they enjoyed it very much; the issue was perhaps down to just that one server .  Worth another try I think, hoping for a more professional server.","3","LolaH","21-06-2018"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","I was looking forward to experiencing The Grounds of the City, what with the buzz surrounding the establishment.  Well, what an enormous let down.    Being a cold rainy day, my friend and I ordered a bottomless cup of tea before lunch.  Why offer a bottomless cup of tea if the staff are loathe to serve even one cup in a timely manner let alone a bottomless cup?   The first cup took 20 minutes to arrive.  Being small cups, the tea was drunk quickly.  The second cup took another 20 minutes to turn up.  We had lunch at this time.  The vegetarian offering was a very lazy one - a choice of a pasta or a salad.  Given that so many people are turning to meat free eating I found this uninspiring box ticking exercise dull.  So many other establishments are at least attempting to make their vegetarian options interesting.  If it s not acceptable to offer the general population just one pasta and one salad dish on the menu, why is it acceptable to have these as the only vegetarian options?  I digress.  Back to the lunch time experience...    Towards the end of lunch we asked for one more cup of tea.  Guess what?  It took 20 minutes to arrive.  At least it was consistently agonisingly slow.  Prior to its arrival, a waiter arrived at our table to inform us that we would have to vacate the table as we had been there too long.  Wow! We had only just had our lunch plates removed, we were 50 minutes into a 60  minute wait for tea, the service was exceptionally slow and poor and we were being asked to leave!  Having expressed our exasperation at the amount of time it took to get service, we were allowed to wait  another 10 minutes for our tea to arrive and to gulp it down before having to vacate the table.  Will I return? No.  Did the experience live up to my expectation? No.  Would I recommend this establishment to others?  Definitely not.","1","MargiH","18-06-2018"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","Was seated as soon as we walked in. The service was really good despite it being relatively busy. Our waiter was friendly, and took our drinks down straight away while we browsed the menu.  The drinks at the grounds have never failed. The Wu sloth of the coffee and the tea always delivers and the presentation is beautiful.  The food however has for some reason become less than sub par. I used to order the omelette with chives and it was always fresh but it seems they’ve changed the menu. More recently when I order food there it seems stale and not so fresh. As if it was prepared in advance and they just tried to heat it in a microwave. I ordered the pancakes and they were not warm, not fluffy like a solid buttermilk pancake should be. It tasted cold, stale and like the presentation was supposed to compensate for the lack of taste. The rhubarb compote and ricotta was fairly decent but the pancake itself just needed work. The same goes for the omelette.   I’m bothered enough to write this because I used to love how fresh the food was when they first opened and wish such quality was maintained.   Aside from the food the service, ambience and setting of the restaurant is beautiful.","3","OpenTable Diner","18-06-2018"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","We ordered the hot chocolates and a pot of tea, the tea arrived quickly, but we waited over 30 minutes for the hot chocolates and when they arrived the milk was barely warm. I booked after looking online at the menu, as being vegetarian, choices are usually very limited when eating out and was disappointed to be told that the menu online I had chosen from was a breakfast  sides  menu and therefore was not available. So we just ordered the French fries, ate them quickly and left. Staff seemed too busy to answer any questions and not much of a cake selection available, nothing special that I was prepared to pay Grounds prices for anyway! Same for the only vegetarian selection off the main menu, which was pasta. I am a good cook and when I pay to eat out I want something that i would not usually make for myself at home. On the up side a (senior) staff member did apologise for the wait on the hot chocolates and knocked them off the bill. I ve been to Grounds of Alexandria, but this was a totally different and not anywhere near as enjoyable experience I am sorry to say.","1","DonnaG","16-06-2018"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","I scored low  for several reasons:  1. I had to ask for the blaring music to be turned down twice and it was still overbearing and not conducive to be able to speak at a normal level. Ruined the ambiance as everyone in the restaurant was shouting over the music - which was POP music - Madonna is really not a great choice for a nice dining experience either.  2. The service was very so-so and very slow.  Slow to take our order. Food slow to arrive. Slow to clear our plates away. We had to flag down the girl with the dessert trolly as no one came near us asking if we wanted dessert or coffee. Had to ask to order more drinks and water.  3. My food was good although expensive. I am confused as to what  Grounds of the City  is trying to be? i.e. a  cafe  or  restaurant ?   4. We arrived at 12:30 and at around 3pm we were  handed our bill  unsolicited (by some dude with a cap on) and asked to settle the bill and leave as the table was wanted.  Ths was rude and extremely unprofessional and considering the slow and so-so and slow service. Overall other than the quality of the food, I was really disappointed. I am not inclined to make any other recommendation to dine here. To me, The Grounds of Alexandria is far superior.","1","EllenB2000","10-06-2018"

Boring I know; but not eating meat , my choices are always limited. I was not disappointed. The beetroot tart was just as yummy.  Our table was next to the kitchen which was not ideal . Clattering plates and staff members having loud conversations was a bit annoying considering that the noise level is pretty high anyway. However, the friendly, helpful service and delicious food and moderately priced but good wine well outweighed any minor whinges. I come from outside of Sydney and have previously found it hard to find somewhere to have lunch in the shopping area which is not in a shopping centre and where I can have a glass of wine so I am happy to have found the Grounds.

I know this may sound trivial but when there is 6 of you eating and coffeeing, having to sort out who is having what is annoying.

But the restaurant is dark and the distance between tables is too short. The waiting time of food is a little bit long during the busy time but it is acceptable. The flavour is good. We ordered the eggs and pork linguine, grilled dory and the Poke Salad. They are delicious, specially the linguine. The pork in it is not dry at all and is easy to chew. The Poke Salad has asian flacour with some ingredients like shallot and coriander. The grilled dory is not dry either and I can tell it is very fresh. The only thing I am not satisfied with is that the sauce vierge with the dory is normal. However, I like this restaurant. Hope the light can be trun up in the furture, and one or two table can be taken away to give more space to customers.","4","KerryJ","13-04-2018"

Tables are a little close together making it feel slightly cramped. The salad lunch options whilst very nice are a little pricy at $25 a pop given they are quite small and essentially just a good quality salad.

Previously though when ordering takeaway wasn’t so pleased that I still was made to pay $23 for avocado and tomatoes on toast (opted to not have the poached egg). Would be nice to see them accomodate for small changes like that to keep customers happy. Have tried the passion fruit cheesecake and strawberry sponge cake and they are OK.

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","We were so looking forward to eating here because the Grounds of Alexandria never disappoints and I have been to the Grounds of the City and been delighted before and I had raved about it to my guests. Unfortunately there was no ice cream so no affogato, no cakes or pastries and not even any English Breakfast tea. Such a disappointment. We travelled from country areas to meet here and enjoy what we expected to be delicious food on a special occasion but were so disappointed. The wait staff were gorgeous and apologetic but it was an enormous wasted effort, sadly.  Would like to try again but it’s hard to find a time we three will be able to meet in Sydney in the foreseeable future 😔","2","AnnieI","08-04-2018"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","I m not sure what Grounds of the City wants to be. I had a 7am booking to meet a friend. Got there a little early and music was pumping but doors were locked tight. Very officious staff member opened the window and door promptly at 7 and I felt special -- like I was being let in to an exclusive club. Prompt service --  too prompt, really. I couldn t savour the coffee menu and my friend was running a few minutes late. I felt rushed and unwelcome. People seating near me ordered, received, consumed and exited in less than half an hour. Is this what GOTC desires? An American food factory personality? The music was loud and had a fast  chew factor  tempo. So, it s not the place for a business meal (can t hear each other); it s not the right venue for a special occasion (can t linger over food or friendship); and it s not  WOW, this is AMAZING food/coffee . This is a shame because I LOVE the look -- the new twist on Old World decor, the twee coffee and pastry menu, the overly gracious wait staff, the flattering lighting. But my  hot  trout tart was lukewarm at best, my juice was served with the bill due to a printer jam and my coffee was ... coffee. I know it s a popular place and Grounds wants to serve as many as it can in the breakfast rush but it all felt too fast, like a friend taking your hand and then sprinting with you through the Louvre.","3","Amanda","27-03-2018"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","The menu needs to properly reflect the actual ingredients in the meal. i ordered a salad and according to the printed menu it didn t contain avocado or coriander but upon receiving my meal, it was full of both. I couldn t therefore eat the meal because i extremely dislike both - especially coriander!   We ordered dessert to only then be told that both of our desserts were not available and therefore had to change our options. there was nothing else on the menu that i particularly liked so i opted for no dessert, which my waistline probably appreciated but my taste buds did not.   Hubby s meal was apparently very tasty and we both got house made soda s which was nice.  I asked a waitress where the bathrooms were and she had no idea so she had to run around and ask another staff member. if staff are starting, i feel like you should probably train them first. Not a fan of the toilets being so far away either.   Overrated and nothing like Alexandria. also ask for water to remain on the table. they don t fill your glasses up frequently enough and we constantly had to ask for top ups.","2","didntlikeitatall","06-02-2018"

These things happen and it was no big deal to us. The reason we won t go back or recommend this place to friends is that one waitress was incredibly rude when we asked her for the bill. She was walking past our table and we asked if we could have our bill. She dropped off a drink at the table next to us then couldn t have been more rude when she then turned on us  what do you want?  and walked off without a word after we asked if we could have the bill.

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","Our son lives in Sydney and he mentioned that The grounds in the city was a sought after breakfast venue. One morning we turned up for  breakfast to be told that the wait for a table was 25 minutes.  We were ok with this so we left, and returned at the time they suggested to come back.  Upon our return we were rudely told it was actually 40minutes in total.  We were too hungry to wait and went elsewhere. However, we decided to try again having made the decision as we were staying in the city and didn t feel like travelling to a suburban area where there are an abundance of fabulous breakfast locations . This time we booked online, strongly suggest you do this.  We got to the restaurant 6 minutes early and were rudely dismissed to come back at the correct time.  We arrived back right on 9.30 to be taken in and there were several tables ready, so we were quite perplexed why it was unacceptable to go in before your  designated  time.  It was our perception that the front desk seems to be run by rigid and and unfriendly individuals.  However, once inside the service was friendly and good.

They have a clear policy of max 1.5 hrs at the table and they mean it. The staff were clearing plates before we’d even finished. I was eating salad with my fingers because they’d cleared the plates and cutlery without asking.  The food however is what you’d expect from The Grounds. Absolutely delicious!

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","Hi there  I just wanted to drop a note to say how disappointed I was with the grounds of the city tonight.   It seems as through your staffing levels were way off the mark. I felt sorry for the staff who were rushed off their feet the whole time. Kudos to them for carrying on.  This was my first time dining there and I had hoped for a semi quiet atmosphere with a nice 3 courses.   Due to your popularity (well done) and Xmas time, the place was packed and I could not hear my friend speak over the noise.   I had to chase the waiters for everything.  I had to ask for the order to be taken, twice. I had to ask for the water on the table, twice. A steak knife wasn’t given, so I had to ask for that. We had to ask for the dessert menu and for the plates to be cleared.   We didn’t end up getting dessert due to the noise and we just could t be bothered asking the over worked waiters to come back again.   It was also too noisy and the dessert wi due that’s open in the day, wasnt there to see the desserts. So, no birthday cake for us.   We simply got up and had to ask for the bill. We paid. We left.  I do want to point out that the steak and bernaise sauce was excellent. As was the presentation of the food. The prices and food selection were very reasonable. I quite liked the decorations and decor   I recommend adding garlic bread to the menu. Or bruschetta.   Overall though. I was pretty disappointed. It felt like a chore being there  Thank you","2","Mardi","21-12-2017"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","Had read mixed reviews but decided to give it a try anyway. Sadly the bad reviews were accurate. Our main problem was the extremely poor service. Having sat down nobody came to us for ten minutes so we couldn’t order a drink . Ordered our food which came promptly. We had a fillet steak and the Jambo prawns, both meals ok nothing exceptional, the steak not cooked to medium rare as requested but medium. A waiter slammed down a glass of water with a grunt of “here!”. After that we did not see a waiter for an hour! Nobody came to ask if we wanted more drinks, which we did. Despite waiters passing by we sat with finished plates for half an hour as several waiters were too busy clearing and setting up tables around us clearly interested in ensuring they had a swift get away at the end of the night. We had wanted dessert but were not offered a dessert menu and by this time had given up being served anything this side of Xmas. The waiter who brought the bill was very rude bordering on ignorant, not at all interested in engaging with us. Overall a very poor experience and we would not recommend this restaurant.","1","OpenTable Diner","20-12-2017"
"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","This was my second visit to the grounds. Had I done this review after the first visit I would of given 5 stars to the food. My issue with the food is I bought the roast potatoes side and I felt it was significantly different (worse) to the first time we ordered it. The ingredients had changed which I can accept (I miss the capers) but the potatoes were not crispy like the first time and was very underwhelming. The best thing I can say about them is that they were cooked. The first time I had them they were delicious. My other gripe is that the gurnard fillets dish was about 90% chips, 10%  fish. Despite all this I will likely give the restaurant another chance, as I’m writing this in the hopes you’ll improve and not to vent.","4","Ray65","20-12-2017"

We waited 25 minutes for our first drinks to arrive and an hour and half for our food after ordering. We did not order starters however this wait seemed a bit much considering the place was not full. When the food did arrive it was underwhelming, not what you expect from such an established group. We were told by the waiter that he was bringing us a couple of free side dishes to make up for the wait. We had nearly finished our main courses by the times these arrived. We wouldn’t have minded waiting so long for the food of the food was excellent however it missed the mark on this occasion.  The long wait was made worse by the fact that there seemed to be little or no ventilation in the whole restaurant  which on a day with 30 degree temperatures was almost unbearable.

I had a reservation but our table wasn t ready when we arrived so the manager, Chris (a lovely Irish guy), took us over to the bar area, got us seats and arranged for us to have a drink on the house while we waited. He could not have been more accomodating or apologietic (despite the fact that we had a wait of less than 15 minutes for our table). It was immpeccable customer service. The wait staff were also fantastic. The only negative is the fact that the rest rooms are on a separate floor in the galleries so it s a bit of a trek.

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","On arrival, the checking of the booking was efficiently managed and was allowed to have the table about 30 minutes before the appointed time. My daughter had the flank steak sandwich (which I ve had before) and she enjoyed it as much as I did when I first had it. I agree with the SMH restaurant review that the sandwich deserves five stars.  I was disappointed with the John Dory as both sides of the fish skin was too salty for my liking. Perhaps, the intent was to have a complementary flavour with the pickled radish on top of the fish, but it just did not work for me. Other guests may like it like that, but not me. This experience was what pulled down my rating on food to three stars. Not wanting to kick up a stink, I worked my way through it and did not complain or offer feedback until now.  I ve had a G&T on a previous visit, and this time, a Lemon Lime Bitters. The use of a star anise as a garnish I found unnecessary. Notwithstanding, the service was above average and I would still come back and know what to avoid. The turn around time to serve drinks I found to be in need of improvement.  And finally, I wanted to experience the cake/pastry trolley which may have happened only for afternoon or morning tea. Maybe next time. All said, it is nice to have a place like the Grounds in the centre of town. More power to all of you, my daughter who was with me that night had been to Alexandria; she commented that your place in town is indeed swankier.","4","OpenTable Diner","05-12-2017"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","We booked a table for 7 people at the Grounds in the City, they operate a system where the hostess shows you one at a time to your table which is quite a lengthy process if a lot of people are arriving at the same time (separate parties).  The table was lovely and the wine glasses are really pretty.  The service wasn t great to be honest and the place was not that busy.  I ordered a meal with the dairy free option which was listed on the menu and when it arrived it wasn t dairy free so I sent it back and had to sit there while everyone else ate and wait till it came again.  It makes you feel what is the point of making  a specific request if they are not going to listen at all and I asked if they had a dairy free sauce instead of the one on the menu - gravy and they said a flat no.  No alternatives were offered and when we asked for tomato sauce we got a long story of how it was in the basement and then they had run out when woolies is literally 100 mts away.  They eventually brought bbq sauce as my friend was finishing her meal so it kind of missed the point.  We asked to pay by card and we had to ask three people three times for the card machine.  They brought it over let one of us pay then took it to another table and we were just sat there wondering what was going on. The toilet situation is not ideal as you have to use the toilets in the Galleries - which I would like to point out are locked before 8pm meaning that if you have a small child, disabled person or pregnant lady there are no local toilets without having to opal tap on in Town Hall station to use their toilets.   I would possibly only get take away coffee from there in the future as I think $38 for a main meal and smoothie is pretty steep when the service isn t great.  I have always been a massive fan of the grounds in Alexandria and this place has a long way to go to reach their level of service.  There are so many great places to go in the city for dinner so I doubt I would return to be honest.","2","OpenTable Diner","14-11-2017"

Ever since its opening on the 1st of June, I have actively brought friends there when they visited Sydney. This was no exception. Again, the ambience was what made the Grounds worth it. The food missed the mark this time because the wait-staff and kitchen didn t time it well. The steak was served first, and the other meal and sides came much longer after that. As a result, the steak ended up being over-cooked. Also, there was a lot of missed opportunities for wait-staff to leave an impression or to offer to serve another wine.. which could have meant more revenue and/or a potential tip. I was quite disappointed this time round compared to my last two visits to the Grounds of the City.","5","Evster","26-10-2017"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","Since replicating some of the experience of The Grounds at Alexandria, the Sydney has sought to capitalise on the strength of that reputation and garner a much bigger audience by opening in The Galeries in central Sydney. Long wait times (currently) can be expected so we booked ahead which at least made the experience slightly less disappointing.  The food was OK - nothing out of the ordinary and nothing that seems to inspire the young and Instagramming crowd of younger people. The interior, while attractive and well presented, offers little ambience since the place has been designed to be rather close fitting and the noise is generally loud and makes conversation difficult.  We had filtered coffees and they were ordinary in one instance and abysmal in the other. The coffee  sommelier  (I ve checked The Grounds job listing and it s a barista with 2 years experience and some further education in talking about  the characteristics of a region ) was asked to taste the same coffee and deemed it satisfactory. Under-extraction and the issue of a sour coffee seems to not be something she can recognise or, more likely, she is simply too enamoured of her own coffees to understand that fair better are available at numerous city and suburban coffess around Sydney. The Grounds at Alexandria seems to offer better ambiance, food and coffee; another server told us about the  special of the day  and then want on to relate how he was able to enjoy the food free as part of his job - a clear sign of an immaturity in the service industry and hardly something that I want to be told when hamburgers are already $25. Overall it s simply not good enough but a place that will likely ride the wave of ongoing tourism for some time as locals will start to abandon this due to the sorts of issues listed.  I won t return.","2","OpenTable Diner","10-09-2017"
"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","This was my first visit, the food was delicious and the service great. The venue decor gorgeous. The only criticism I would make is when you arrive, there should be two lines one for the booked in guests and the other for the walk in guests, especially during busy times, it was very  frustrating to have to wait in line when you have a booking.","4","AndrewP","10-09-2017"

They were running late so even though I had made a booking they still took over 15 minutes to find us a table.I found the atmosphere very noisy,just like a bar or nightclub so it was hard to have a conversation. I ordered a cappuccino which was of only average quality. But the worst thing was the passionfruit cheesecake which cost a full $7.50 and was only about 8cm x 8cm x 3cm in size! Unbelievable and a total ripoff compared to most other cafe s cakes!","2","Citycakelover","26-08-2017"

"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","Glad we booked with Open Table because the queues were an hour long even at 3pm. Welcome was very inviting, The Grounds team have done an excellent job with the decor theme as expected, giving off a Victorian steampunk vibe. Dim lighting inside added to the experience. Consistently positive staff. The tables were bunched up closesly, leaving half a body s width between. It was difficult to have a conversation over the loud noise and the lack of privacy from neighbouring tables. Would not recommend for an intimate date.   No complaints about the coffee, enjoyed my latte just how I liked it and my friend had the deconstructed mocha (as they did not have a  constructed  mocha available on the menu - not sure if this was worth an extra $3).   Food menu was a bit on the pricey side, but usual for The Grounds. I had the smashed potatoes (ordered a side as I had already eaten previously), which were overly salted. Although I liked the generous serving, it was very boring eating through it. My friend ordered the tenderloin which was cooked right, but seemed dry. For the price of that dish, we could have gone to a pub for 3 steaks and still have left overs for drinks.","3","dception","19-08-2017"
"opentable","The Grounds of the City","500 George St Sydney, AU-NSW  2000","We went for the Charred Jumbo Yamba Prawns and Lee Fisheries John Dory with a side of Shoestring Fries. Fish was beautifully tender, combination of flavours was good, with decent portion sizes and a relatively quick serving time. Staff were friendly and accommodating. The space is well designed, however there is not a lot of room to move. Oh, and be aware of snooping diners on the other side of the partition. Napkins come in handy for filling up the gap and blocking prying eyes, and a shake of pepper on the ledge can help discourage it too.","4","Rose","19-08-2017"
