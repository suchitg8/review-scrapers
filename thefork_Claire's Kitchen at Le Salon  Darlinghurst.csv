Service in the other hand, I was trying to order a coffee after my meal, and tried to get the waiter to look into our table multiple times to no success. It was at least a 30 minutes after we finish all the meal and I decided to stand up and walk to someone to request the bill, as the waiter would absolutely not look into our table. I ended the night without a coffee and thought the meals are amazing, I was a bit unhappy with the service. ","8","Anonymous","20-07-2019"

The wine was ok, however we did order the 1/3 and 2/3 carafes in order to match our wines with  courses with only 2 of us dining rather than share a whole bottle. The concept of this was great but we did expect the wine for the price could have been of a bit higher quality.
